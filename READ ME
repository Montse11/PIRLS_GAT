This repository contains the code for data simulation and analysis for the paper "How Can PIRLS Take Advantage of Adaptive Testing?".

The R files contain the code for the simulation and are ordered according to the way in which they should be used. 
The data that helped inform the simulation are available online [https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/pirls2016/international-database/index.html] and stored in CSV files in this folder.
